Class ArrayList:-


public class ArrayList
extends AbstractList
implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable

Package: java.util.ArrayList



Array list:-
   1.ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. 
   2.It is like an array, but there is no size limit.
   3.We can add or remove elements anytime
   4.it is much more flexible than the traditional array.
   5.it contain duplicate elements also
   6.ArrayList maintains the insertion order internally.



The important points about Java ArrayList class are::-
   1.Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
   2.Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
   3.Java ArrayList class is non synchronized
   4.Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
   5.In ArrayList, manipulation is little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java 
   6.because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
