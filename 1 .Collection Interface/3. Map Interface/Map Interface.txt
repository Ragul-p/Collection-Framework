public interface Map


Map:-
   1.A map contains values on the basis of key
   2.key and value pair 
   3.Each key and value pair is known as an entry. 
   4.A Map contains unique keys.
   5.A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.


   1.A Map doesn't allow duplicate keys, but you can have duplicate values.  
   2.HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
   3.A Map can't be traversed, so you need to convert it into Set using keySet() or entrySet() method.
